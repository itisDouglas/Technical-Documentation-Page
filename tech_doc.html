            <h3>Introduction to Python</h3>
            <p>
                Python is simple to use, but it is a real programming language, offering much more structure and support for large programs than shell scripts or batch files can offer. On the other hand, Python also offers much more error checking than C, and, being a very-high-level language, it has high-level data types built in, such as flexible arrays and dictionaries. Because of its more general data types Python is applicable to a much larger problem domain than Awk or even Perl, yet many things are at least as easy in Python as in those languages.</p>

<p>Python allows you to split your program into modules that can be reused in other Python programs. It comes with a large collection of standard modules that you can use as the basis of your programs — or as examples to start learning to program in Python. Some of these modules provide things like file I/O, system calls, sockets, and even interfaces to graphical user interface toolkits like Tk.</p>

<p>Python is an interpreted language, which can save you considerable time during program development because no compilation and linking is necessary. The interpreter can be used interactively, which makes it easy to experiment with features of the language, to write throw-away programs, or to test functions during bottom-up program development. It is also a handy desk calculator.
            </p>

            <p>By the way, the language is named after the BBC show “Monty Python’s Flying Circus” and has nothing to do with reptiles. Making references to Monty Python skits in documentation is not only allowed, it is encouraged!</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Hello_World!">
            <header>
                <h3>Hello World!</h3>
                <p>To see what can be done with Python, or any programming language for that matter, printing out the words "Hello World!" is a tradition for most programmers venturing to new languages. Fortunately Python allows this to be done quickly. See the below code.</p>
                <code>>>> print("Hello World!")
                    <br>Hello World!<br>>>>
                </code>
                <p>It is assumed the reader of this documentation has the latest version of Python installed and ready to go.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
            <header>
                <h3>Variables</h3>
                <p>Python is a simple language. Notice that there are no semicolons required. Instead, Python depends on spacing and indentation.</p>
                <p>The next few examples demonstrate how to declare variables.</p>
                <code>>>> x = 4<br>
                    >>> y = 7<br>
                    >>> x + y<br>
                    11</code>
                <p>In Python a variables type doesn't need to be specified, the interpreter already infers the type.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Constants">
            <header>
                <h3>Constants</h3>
                <p>There is no special way to declar constants in Python. There is only one rule and that is to capitalize your constant's name. See the below example:</p>
                <code>>>> SALES_TAX = 7.5<br>
                    >>> print(SALES_TAX)<br>
                    7.5</code>

        <section class="main-section" id="Data_Types">
            <header>
                <h3>Data Types</h3>
                <p>The following the six standard data types in Python:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Integer</li>
                    <li>Float</li>
                    <li>String</li>
                    <li>List</li>
                    <li>Tuple</li>
                    <li>Set</li>
                    <li>Dictionary</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The following are examples of each of these data types:</p>
                <code>>>> #Integer<br>
                    >>> a = 5<br>
                    >>> print(a)<br>
                    5</code><br><br>
                <code>>>> #Float<br>
                    >>> b = 5.1<br>
                    >>> print(b)<br>
                    5.1</code><br><br>
                <code>>>> #String<br>
                    >>> word = "Hello!"<br>
                    >>> print(word)<br>
                    Hello!</code><br><br>
                <code>>>> #List<br>
                    >>> List = [2, 4, 5, "Hello again!"]<br>>>> print(List[3])<br>
                    Hello again!</code><br><br>
                <code>>>> #Tuple <br>>>> aTuple = (1, 2, 3, "Python")<br>
                    >>> print(aTuple[3])<br>
                    Python</code><br><br>
                    <code>>>> #Set<br>>>> aSet = {1,2,3,"More Python"}<br>
                        >>> print(aSet)<br>
                        {1, 2, 3, 'More Python'}</code><br><br>
                    <code>>>> #Dictionary<br>
                        >>> Dict = {1: "hello", 2:"hello, again", 3: "Hi"}<br>
                        >>> print(Dict)
                        {1: 'hello', 2: 'hello, again', 3: 'Hi'}<br>
                        >>> print(Dict[2])
                        hello, again</code>

        <section class="main-section" id="If...else_statement">
            <header>
                <h3>If...else Statement</h3>
                <p>In python the if statement is written with "if" keyword followed by the variables you want to evaluate and the logical conditions; you finish the if statement with a colon. </p>
                <p>After the colon, you indent, letting the Python interpreter know that whatever comes after the colon is what should happen after the condition has been evaluated.</p>
                <p>When you need an else statement, simply indent to the line below and use the keyword <code>else</code> followed by a colon. After the colon, simply write whatever will happen if the initial evaluation fails. See the below example:</p>
                <code>>>> #If Else<br>
                    >>> a = 11<br>
                    >>> b = 100<br>
                    >>> if b > a:
                        print("b is greater than a")
                    else: print("a is greater than b")<br>
                    
                    b is greater than a</code>
